ProfitMate is a simple yet powerful mobile app built using Python's Kivy framework. Its purpose is to help users quickly calculate profit and profit percentage by entering just two values: Cost Price (CP) and Selling Price (SP). As soon as the user types in these values, the app automatically calculates the profit earned and the percentage of profit gained.

The interface is clean and minimal, with a bright yellow background and large, readable text — making it extremely user-friendly, especially for users with limited tech experience. A dedicated Clear button allows the user to instantly reset all fields and start fresh. The app supports real-time updates, so users don’t need to press any extra buttons to see results. It displays the final profit in rupees (₹) and the profit percentage to two decimal places.

This app is particularly useful for:

🛍️ Small business owners and shopkeepers who need to quickly check their profit margins on products.

📚 Students learning basic business or math concepts related to profit and loss.

📦 Traders and resellers calculating cost versus selling price efficiency.

👨‍💼 Salespeople who want to evaluate pricing strategy.


With its simplicity, speed, and clean design, ProfitMate serves as a handy pocket calculator for anyone dealing with buying and selling goods. Whether you're running a store, studying commerce, or just budgeting a sale, this app makes profit calculation effortless and instant.
